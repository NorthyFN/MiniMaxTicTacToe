# MiniMaxTicTacToe

Python Code for TicTacToe with an AI using MiniMax.
Both files need to be in the same folder and you need to have numpy installed.

Make a move by typing the letter of the column and the row eg. B3(case doesnt matter). There is no errorhandling in case you don't use that syntax so be careful...

You can edit the parameters for GRID_SIZE, WINNING_LENGTH and MINIMAX_DEPTH (the amount of moves MiniMax looks into the future)
